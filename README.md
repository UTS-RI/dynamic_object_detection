This is the repository that contains the source code for the [related project website](https://uts-ri.github.io/dynamic_object_detection/). This code is a modified version of the [Nerfies website](https://nerfies.github.io); most of the original "features" of the page are still there and just commented on.

The documentation to host a webpage on GitHub is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
